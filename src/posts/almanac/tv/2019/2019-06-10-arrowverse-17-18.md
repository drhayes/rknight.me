- Arrow was way better than it had been in previous seasons. They could have just ended it here.
- Flash was more of the same, but I enjoyed it.
- Supergirl was good. Jon Cryer as Lex Luthor was amazing, although he could have been _more_ sinister.
- Legends is ridiculous as this point and I love it.
