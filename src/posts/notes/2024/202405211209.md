I'm so exhausted by various self-hosted projects that say "It's easy to host on {Netlify|Vercel|CloudFlare}" with no thought about what happens when those companies no longer offer a free tier, get too expensive, or you just want to move off of them. One specific host as part of the infrastructure is a terrible idea.

Do you know what's nice and easy to install on a server and not locked to one vendor? PHP.
