Having only watched [the TV show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones_(TV_series)) until now, I didn't know what to expect and was concerned I might be just re-reading the show. Jessica is different to her portrayal in the show, which is to be expected, but I enjoyed it. Cameos from other Marvel characters make this a lot of fun to read and something I wish they could do more in the show.
