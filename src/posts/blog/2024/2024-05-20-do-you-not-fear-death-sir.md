I don’t have a driving licence. I’ve lived most of my adult life in Portsmouth which is one of the most densely populated cities in the UK[^1]. We have a pretty decent bus system, taxis used to be cheap (not so much the past few years), we have rental scooters, and we have _five_ train stations. So public transport isn’t an issue. 

But I have Baby Knight now and my wife has to do all the errands that require driving which is less than ideal so I’m starting lessons this week. 

My mum passed away last year and my dad still had her car so he kindly offered to give it to me. He insured me on it so I could get some extra practice in when we see him. 

We visited him yesterday and he said “I’ll drive us somewhere quiet for your first go”. Seemed reasonable. 

We drove around in circles on an industrial estate for a bit then I pulled over so he could take over and drive us back and he said "Why don't you drive us back?". Literally haven't driven a car in maybe 15 years but sure why don't I drive back on roads I don't know to your house.

_Do you not fear death, sir?_.

It was fine, no one died, we made it back in one piece. Still. The man clearly has no fear.
