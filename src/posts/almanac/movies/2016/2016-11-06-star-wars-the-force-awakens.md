My first Star Wars. Pretty good.

Tweet thread:

> Started Force Awakens and they use a four-dot ellipsis in the intro so it's basically unwatchable.

> Also this my first Star Wars.

> Oh I thought storm troopers were robots. There's people in there.

> Rey is such a badass.

> BB-8 is adorable.

> I had to stop watching to do some other stuff. Will continue tomorrow.

> Watching the rest now. On my laptop. Like a good millennial.

> Oh its the alien from the "Its a trap" meme. I think.

> It was pretty good.
