A really easy recipe that Baby Knight can't get enough of.

Ingredients:

- 500g beef mince  
- 500g passata  
- 250g of orzo  
- 1 beef stock cube  
- Grated cheese


1. Brown off the mince in a saucepan
2. Add the passata, the stock cube, and the orzo, plus 250ml of water
3. Simmer for about 20 minutes while stirring it occasionally otherwise it'll all stick together
4. Stir in the cheese and any seasoning you fancy

Easy peasy. This makes a decent amount of portions for freezing.
